# Full CRUD React Application with API Integration and Local Storage/Redux

A project designed to demonstrate full CRUD operations in a React.js application. The app integrates with an external API, supports form handling, local storage (or Redux), and includes optimization using various React hooks.

---

## Task Overview

Create a React.js application that performs full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a list of users. The app should fetch initial data from an external API and allow users to perform CRUD actions on this data. Local changes should persist in the browserâ€™s local storage or Redux.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Initial Data Fetch
- Use Axios to fetch a list of users from an external API (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) on component mount.
- Store the fetched data using `useState`.
- Display data in a table with columns: **Name, Email, Phone, Actions (Edit/Delete)**.

### 2. Local Storage / Redux Integration
- After fetching data, save it in local storage (or Redux) using `useEffect`.
- On reload, load data from local storage if available, otherwise fetch from the API.
- Use `useState` and `useEffect` to manage and sync data.

### 3. Add New User
- Provide a form to add a new user with fields: **Name, Email, Phone**.
- Use `useReducer` to manage the form state.
- Add the new user to the list and update local storage.
- Clear form inputs after submission.

### 4. Edit User
- Implement an **Edit** button for each user row.
- Populate form with existing user data on edit click.
- Toggle between add and edit modes using `useState`.
- Update data in the list and local storage after editing.

### 5. Delete User
- Implement a **Delete** button for each user.
- Remove the user from the list and update local storage.
- Optimize rendering using `useMemo`.

### 6. Search Functionality
- Add a search bar to filter users by name.
- Use `useRef` to optimize the input field.
- Use `useCallback` to memoize the search function.

### 7. Error Handling
- Display meaningful messages for API fetch failures.
- Use `useState` for managing error state and render conditionally.

### 8. Custom Hook (Bonus)
- Create a reusable `useLocalStorage` hook for interacting with local storage.

---

## Bonus Features
- Follow best practices in React development.
- Implement form validation (e.g., required fields for Name and Email).
- Optimistic UI updates for editing/deleting.
- Redux implementation instead of local storage.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Axios and API integration
- CRUD logic implementation
- Local Storage / Redux state persistence
- Form state management and validation
- Custom Hooks
